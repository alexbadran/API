Pre-requistes: You must either install the oauth and json gem or include it in your Gemfile 

This is a semi-functional implementation of authenticating using OAuth and Kiva in Ruby.

It will put the information it retrieves from the API into a user's session, currently just their e-mail, and display it at the end.

NOTE: You'll want to copy oauth_controller.rb to your app/controllers/ folder and oauth_controller.html.erb to your app/views controller, and add the two routes listed in routes.rb to your config/routes.rb file

Pull requests happily accepted.
